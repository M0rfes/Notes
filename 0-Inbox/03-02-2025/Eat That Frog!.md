## some important facts

Hoping to finish all your tasks and be done with them is not realistic.
We will never finish everything; there is never enough time. Therefore, we can only focus on the most essential tasks. The rest of the low-priority tasks can wait or be delegated.

# Use this 7-step plan to figure things out and make a plan-out thing.

1. **Decide what you want done** â€” either yourself or with your Boss. Try to find a balance between life goals and career goals. This plan applies not only to jobs but to life as well. Knowing what we want is the first step towards achieving it. Because the worst use of once time is doing something that was not needed in the first place
2. **Write** The goals we agreed upon in step one. Writing them down is the first step towards making your goals real. A goal or dream that is not written down is no more than a wish. 
3. **Set Deadline**: Break down the over-arching goal into specific milestones. And have deadlines for those milestones cause without a deadline, there won't be an urgency to get them done, which leads to procrastination and results in very little being done
4. **Make a list**. List down items/things/skills required to complete your milestone. This will give a set task that needs urgent attention and lay down a road map for you to achieve your goal one task at a time
5. **Make a Plan**. Use the list we made in step 4 to generate a plan/ action times. The list will tell us what we know and need to know. We should do high-priority tasks first and any other task that is blocking a high-priority task. The list will tell us what can be done now and what can be done later
6. **Take action**. Once we have a plan, let's start doing it. We shouldn't spend time on needless optimisation cause an average plan that is executed is far better than an optimal strategy that never gets executed. And we will have time to re-calibrate our plan once we get started
7. **Do something each day**. Make sure we are doing something, no matter how small. This will make sure we are on track and motivated, and nothing sets in procrastination faster than watching your TODO list grow and no task being done
