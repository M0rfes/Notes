### Some important facts

Hoping to finish all your tasks and be done with them is not realistic.
We will never finish everything; there is never enough time. Therefore, we can only focus on the most essential tasks. The rest of the low-priority tasks can wait or be delegated.

### Visualise

See yourself where you want to be. This will help us find people already there, and we can ask them what to do, or if we can't ask, we can try to read about how they got there and emulate it
# Use this 7-step plan to figure things out and make a plan-out thing.

1. **Decide what you want done** â€” either yourself or with your Boss. Try to find a balance between life goals and career goals. This plan applies not only to jobs but to life as well. Knowing what we want is the first step towards achieving it. Because the worst use of once time is doing something that was not needed in the first place
2. **Write** The goals we agreed upon in step one. Writing them down is the first step towards making your goals real. A goal or dream that is not written down is no more than a wish. 
3. **Set Deadline**: Break down the over-arching goal into specific milestones. And have deadlines for those milestones cause without a deadline, there won't be an urgency to get them done, which leads to procrastination and results in very little being done
4. **Make a list**. List down items/things/skills required to complete your milestone. This will give a set task that needs urgent attention and lay down a road map for you to achieve your goal one task at a time
5. **Make a Plan**. Use the list we made in step 4 to generate a plan/ action times. The list will tell us what we know and need to know. We should do high-priority tasks first and any other task that is blocking a high-priority task. The list will tell us what can be done now and what can be done later
6. **Take action**. Once we have a plan, let's start doing it. We shouldn't spend time on needless optimisation cause an average plan that is executed is far better than an optimal strategy that never gets executed. And we will have time to re-calibrate our plan once we get started
7. **Do something each day**. Make sure we are doing something, no matter how small. This will make sure we are on track and motivated, and nothing sets in procrastination faster than watching your TODO list grow and no task being done


# Plan every day.
`Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance`

We should Plan each day, each Week, each Month and Each Year. Make a master List. This will have items we want to accomplish over a year; now, plan for a month of things we should have done by the end of this month. At the start of the week, plan for the week to spend about 2 hours each Sunday. And every night, plan for the upcoming day. This list will have tasks that are to be done in the day. As we work through them, we will tick off each task, and by the end of the day, we will move the remaining functions to the next day's task. Doing this will help us focus and keep track of our overarching goals.

# Focus on Activities and not Accomplishments.

We can busy ourselves by doing tasks in arbitrary order and not accomplish anything meaningfully. Instead, we should do high-priority tasks, contributing more to our overall goal. No matter how simple the low-priority task is, we should start with higher-priority tasks and only get t low-priority tasks when we have time for them. Follow the _80/20_ rule, i.e. **80%** of our success will be from **20%** of our most important tasks. 

# Considering the Consequences

We should have a long-term perspective. Individuals with long-term plans also take good designs in the short term. Be mindful of the consequences of doing or not doing a task. Sometimes, we must face short-term pain/setbacks/losses for our long-term plan to work out.
One should focus on the core skills that give them a strategic advantage in the long term. And work on them in the short term. 

## Law of Forced Efficiency

`There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always sufficient time to focus on what is the most important thing`.

People say they work better under deadlines, but pressure leads to more mistakes and rework. It's ideal to plan your work in advance and then add an extra _20%_ buffer for errors and rework.

Ask yourself. `What are my highest-value activities?` before starting, i.e. what are some tasks, if done, will have the most returns for me or what tasks are not done, will have the worst outcome for me

`What is something only I can do? And if done, it will make a real difference.`

If you can't answer this question on your own, ask your **family**, your **boss** or your **colleague**
